{"items": [{"id": "2ad40077-7ec8-45cc-a6b6-0eb2d87e1611", "claim": "The capital provider cannot stipulate that the Mudarib receives profit from one specific amount of capital while the provider takes profit from another, nor can they assign profits from different financial periods or transactions to the Mudarib and themselves separately.", "chunk_id": 64, "chunk_text": "8/5 If one of the parties stipulates that he should receive a lump sum of money, the Mudarabah contract shall be void. This rule does not apply to a situation where the parties agree that if the profit is over a particular ceiling then one of the parties will take the additional profit and if the profit is below or equal to the amount of the ceiling the distribution of profit will be in accordance with their agreement.\n\n8/6 It is not permissible for the capital provider to give the Mudarib two amounts of capitals on condition that the profit earned on one of the two amounts would be taken by the Mudarib while the capital provider would take the profit earned on the other amount. It is not also permissible for the capital provider to state that the profit of one financial period would be taken by the Mudarib and the capital provider would take the profit of the following financial period. Similarly, it is not permissible to assign the profit from a particular transaction to the Mudarib and the profit from another transaction to the capital provider.\n\n8/7 No profit can be recognised or claimed unless the capital of the Mudarabah is maintained intact. Whenever a Mudarabah operation incurs losses, such losses stand to be compensated by the profits of future operations of the Mudarabah. The losses brought forward should be set against the future profits. All in all, the distribution of profit depends on the final result of the operations at the time of liquidation of the Mudarabah contract. If losses are greater than profits at the time of liquidation, the balance (net loss) must be deducted from the capital. In this case, as he is a trustee the Mudarib is not liable for the amount of this loss, unless there is negligence or misconduct on his part. If the total Mudarabah expenses are equal to the total Mudarabah revenues, the capital provider will receive his capital back without either profit or loss, and there will be no profit in which the Mudarib is entitled to a share. If profit is realised, it must be distributed between the parties as per the agreement.\n\n8/8 The Mudarib is entitled to a share of profit as soon as it is clear that the operations of the Mudarabah have led to the realisation of a profit. However, this entitlement is not absolute, as it is subject to the retention of interim profits for the protection of the capital. It will be an absolute right only after distribution, i. e. when actual or constructive valuations take place. It is permissible to distribute the realised profit among the parties on account, in which case the distribution will be revised when actual or constructive valuation takes place. The final distribution of profit should be made based on the selling price of the Mudarabah assets, which is known as actual valuation. It is also permissible that the profit be distributed on the basis of constructive valuation, which is valuation of the assets on the basis of fair value. Receivables shall be measured at the cash equivalent, or net realisable value, i. e. after the deduction of a provision for doubtful debts. In measuring receivables, neither time value (interest rate) nor discount on current value for extension of period of payment shall be taken into consideration.\n\n8/9 If the Mudarib has commingled his own funds with the Mudarabah funds, the Mudarib becomes a partner in respect of his funds and a Mudarib in respect of the funds of the capital provider. The profit earned on the two commingled funds will be divided proportionately to the amounts of the two funds, in which case the Mudarib takes the profit attributable to his own funds, while the remaining profit is to be distributed between the Mudarib and the capital provider according to the provisions of the Mudarabah contract.\n\n9. Duties and Powers of the Mudarib\n\nThe Mudarib should employ his best efforts to accomplish the objectives of the Mudarabah contract. The Mudarib should assure the capital provider that his money is in good hands that will act to find the best ways of investing it in a permissible manner.\n\n9/1 If a Mudarabah c"}]}

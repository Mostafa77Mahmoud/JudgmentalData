(32)\n\nSee: Fatwa No. (219) of the Fatwas of Kuwait Finance House.\n\nAppendix (C) Definitions\n\nContract Partnership (Sharikat al-’Aqd)\n\nContract partnership is an agreement between two or more parties to combine their assets or to merge their services or obligations and liabilities with the aim of making profit.\n\nPartnership of Ownership (Sharikat al-Milk)\n\nPartnership of ownership (Sharikat al-Milk) is the combination of the assets of two or more persons in a manner that creates a state of sharing the realised profit or income or benefiting from an increase in the value of the partnership assets.

The ownership partnership is created by events beyond the partners’ control such as the inheritance rights of heirs in the legacy of a deceased person. This partnership is also created by the wish of the partners such as when two or more parties acquire common shares in a particular asset.\n\nMufawadah Partnership\n\nMufawadah partnership is any partnership in which the parties are equal in all respects, such as funds contributed by them, their right to act and their liability, from the commencement of the partnership to the date of its termination.\n\nSharecropping Partnership (Muzara’ah)\n\nSharecropping is partnership in crops in which one party presents land to another for cultivation and maintenance in consideration for a common defined share in the crop.\n\nIrrigating Partnership (Musaqat)\n\nIrrigating partnership is a partnership that depends on one party presenting designated plants/trees that produce edible fruits to another in order to work on their irrigation in consideration for a common defined share in the fruits.\n\nAgricultural Partnership (Mugharasah)\n\nAgricultural partnership is a partnership in which one party presents a treeless piece of land to another to plant trees on it on the condition that they share the trees and fruits in accordance with a defined percentage.\n\nDistribution of Proceeds and Profits\n\nDistribution of proceeds and profits is a process of termination an undivided ownership in the company by the final distribution of the assets whereby rights of each partner are defined and common shares are partitioned into identified sets for each partner. This is why distribution is defined as identification of undefined shares or proceeds of a particular person.\n\nSubject\tPage\n\nPreface. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t369\n\nStatement of the Standard. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t370\n\nScope of the Standard. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
